# System Design

## Situation

An investor asks you to take $1,000,000 (one million dollars) and deploy a website that hosts realtime stats for all events in the next Winter Olympics including leaderboards by different categories. Some quick research tells you you can expect about 360,000,000 requests per day during 17 days of the olympic games. 


## Deliverable

Make a system design for the "realtime olympics stats dashboard" and identify any bottlnecks and scaling constraints. Identify any security boundaries and explain how security is maintained. Identify costs for maintaining the site at peak load for 17 days and half load for 17 more days. Draw a picture and label each component and technology. Include a table of technologies you'll use and the associated costs (show your work on how you calculate these costs).
