This promise is for you. It is for everyone who reads the Book of Mormon with a sincere heart, real intent, and faith in Christ. The Book of Mormon is not just a historical record, it is a message of Jesus Christ and His gospel. It testifies of His Atonement, Resurrection, and saving power.

As you read the Book of Mormon, focus on the principal figure in the book, the Lord Jesus Christ. Look for the second undergirding theme of God's covenants with the remnants of the house of Israel. Remember that the Book of Mormon is a crucial component of God's covenant with His people.

When you read the Book of Mormon, you will find testimonies of Jesus Christ from ancient American prophets who lived before His birth in Bethlehem. Their testimonies of Christ, His mission, and His ministry are powerful and inspiring. They declare that Jesus is the Christ, our Savior and Redeemer.
